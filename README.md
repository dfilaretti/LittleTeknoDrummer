# LDS - Little Drum Synth

A simple drum synthesiser plugin inspired by the awesome [Sonic Charge Microtonic](https://soniccharge.com/microtonic), one of my favourite plugins.
All sounds are synthesised in realtime, no samples are used. 

It is written in C++ and the [JUCE](https://juce.com/) framework.
